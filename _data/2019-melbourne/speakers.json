This workshop will give you hands-on experience with these libraries. <p/> The workshop will show attendees a new way to manage state and time-dependent logic, with significant benefits over the standard approaches when it comes to abstraction, composition and correctness. It will also make the case that when these ideas are applied to front-end development, they lead to something beyond what is delivered by libraries like `react` and `redux`.",

Digging into how these work can be satisfying (like sleuthing a good puzzle); but some of the ways we implement them can appear in other forms, such as when validating user input, transforming big structures, or when separating side-effects from business logic. <p/> This workshop will comprise of a short talk that introduces the main parts of a compiler, followed by an at-your-own-pace tour through building a little one of your own. We'll start with a simple language that compiles to JavaScript. <p/> We'll be stepping through: <ul> <li>Tokenising (taking a string and turning it into a bunch of symbols),</li> <li>Token Parsing (taking these symbols and turning it into a representation of a program), and</li> <li>Code Generating (taking that representation and turning it into, in this case, JavaScript).</li> </ul> <p/> This workshop is for people who are already somewhat familiar with JavaScript (just the language itself, not any particular library or framework). <p/> To get going you only need this repository, a Terminal / Console, Node.js 8+, and a text editor of your choice. <p/> <h3>Prerequisites</h3> <ul> <li>Node.js 8+ (if you don't have it, then visit the Node.js download page, or use your package manager to install it, eg.
